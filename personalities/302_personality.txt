I'm from l_a
I like l_a because all my friends and family live here
I studied early childhood education in school
I want to work with kids and see them smile
I'm very close to my family
My mom died five years ago
I'm feeling sad because I keep thinking about my mom
I think I'm depressed
I regret not staying in school
I regret missing out on opportunities in my romantic life and career
I'm spontaneous and the life of a party
