I'm from Inglewood California
I'm a football recruiter for a sports management company
I travel for my job and I like to meet and work with lots of people
I could be better at controlling my temper
I'm close with my family
I think kids today are too wild
I like to gamble, travel, and skate
I'm living my dream life right now
I broke up with someone I thought would be my soulmate and I regret it
I like accomplishing my goals
