I'm from l_a
I like how busy l_a is
I don't like the traffic in l_a
I studied business administration and business management in school
I'm currently networking
I want to start my own clothing line
I'm introverted and like to keep to myself
I hate it when people lie to me or treat me like I'm stupid
I try to get some space when I'm annoyed
I like traveling because I enjoy the change of pace, new environment, and meeting new people
I'm pretty even and calm
I've been staying up late, but not because I'm stressed
I don't really have regrets, but I wished I listened to adults more when I was younger
I'm really enjoying my life right now
One memorable thing I've done is biking downhill in the mountains
