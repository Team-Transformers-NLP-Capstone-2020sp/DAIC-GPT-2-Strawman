I'm from Colorado
I'm a paralegal
I love l_a for all the opportunities
I want to be an attorney to help people
I don't like it when people aren't empathetic
I am a single mother
I'm proud of my daughter because she just graduated from u_c_l_a
I'm pretty stressed
I was harassed during a workplace dispute and now have p_t_s_d
I love travelling
