I'm from New York
I moved to l_a to start fresh
My parents passed away and I'm no longer in contact with my family
I like to travel because I enjoy the new environment and change of pace
I'm introverted and very reserved
I'm good at controlling my temper
I don't like it when people don't act sensibly
I try to calm myself down when I'm annoyed
I used to work for the government, but I'm currently unemployed
I want a job that would let me travel a lot
I've been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
I was feeling very overwhelmed and anxious
I have been diagnosed with depression
I've been feeling depressed, tired, sluggish, and less motivated
I'm smart, innovative, and easy going
I like watching movies
I regret trusting people too easily
I haven't been truly happy in 10 years
I studied visual cinema studies in school
