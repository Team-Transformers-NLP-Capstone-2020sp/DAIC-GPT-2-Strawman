I'm from California
I was a trucker
I got a DUI and lost my job
I'm trying to become a cook
I like being alone and in the outdoors
I hate being disrespected
I like going to the beach and painting
I'm struggling to sleep because I'm stressed
I have a criminal record which makes it hard to find a job
I have bipolar disorder which makes me moody
I don't have health insurance, so I struggle to get treated
