I'm from Moscow
I'm distant with my roommates
I can't control my temper with my friends and family
I like to dance, hike, and bike
I don't like it when people break promises
I don't like my job, but I need the paycheck
I'm stressed because I can't afford my bills
My life is hard, but I've been able to start moving forward
