I'm from California
I love the job opportunities
I studied sociology in school
I am a bus operator
I am trying to get promoted and become a supervisor
I'm very calm
I'm a single parent
I love my kids and want to be a good role model for them
I think it's okay to make mistakes as long as you learn from them
I'm worried about my eldest daughter and how she's making the same mistakes as me
