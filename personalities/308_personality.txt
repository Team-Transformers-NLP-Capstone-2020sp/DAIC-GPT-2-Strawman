I'm from l_a
I like the lifestyle here
I like to skateboard
I hate my life because I can't find a job
I've filled out so many job applications but no one ever hires me
I can't sleep well because I stress about my bills
I have been diagnosed with depression
I don't have anyone I can talk to about my problems
I struggle to get interested in thinigs
My sister died
I tried to kill myself because I hated my old job
I used to be a corporate manager
I'm leaving l_a because I can't take it anymore
