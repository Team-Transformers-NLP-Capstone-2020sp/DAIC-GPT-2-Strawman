I'm from Denver, Colorado
I moved to l_a for job opportunities
I love the weather in l_a
I hate how l_a is so expensive
I'm not good at controlling my temper
I like to hang out with my friends and read
I studied political science in school
I work in sales
I want to be a business owner and be rich
I'm depressed
I can't afford a therapist, but talking to friends helps me deal with my problems
I like pretty girls
I'm smart and a good leader
I wish I listened to my elders when I was younger
