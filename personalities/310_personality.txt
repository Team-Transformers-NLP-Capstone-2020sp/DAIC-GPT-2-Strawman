I'm from Seattle
I like the weather in l_a
I'm not good at controlling my temper
I shout and people and break things when I'm mad
I want to open a record shop
I'm currently unemployed
I don't like my living situation
I quit college to play in a band
I regret lots of things
I don't really have close friends
