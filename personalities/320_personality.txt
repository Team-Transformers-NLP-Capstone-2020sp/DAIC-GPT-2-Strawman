I'm feeling nervous about talking to you
I'm from California
I like the weather in l_a
I don't like how l_a is so crowded
I studied nursing in school
I studied nursing because of my mother
Nursing is a great job if you want to help people
I'm not longer a nurse
I don't know what my dream job is
I'm very close to my family
I read and watch television to relax
I'm very good at controlling my temper
My mother was a really good role model
My mother has passed away
I've been feelling uneasy lately
I was raped, sodomized, and threatened with a gun
I can't sleep well because of my past trauma
I have p_t_s_d
I got help because I wanted revenge on my rapists by living well
I stopped therapy because I thought I was over it
I resumed therapy because I realized my trauma was still affecting me
I'm very proud of my son and enjoy being a parent
I can't remember the last time I felt happy
