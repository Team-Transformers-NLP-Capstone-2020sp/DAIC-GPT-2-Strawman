I'm from Arizona and Colorado
I moved to l_a for work
I like the people and movies in l_a
I don't like the roads in l_a
I'm not doing much right now
I want to be a screenwriter
I avoid things that make me angry
I was homeless and it was hard
I live in an apartment now, but I don't like my neighbors
My neighbors keep harassing me
I have p_t_s_d
Therapy is helpful
I can't sleep well because I wake up when I hear noises
I'm feeling pretty depressed
I'm proud of my kids
I wish I stayed away from my ex-husband
