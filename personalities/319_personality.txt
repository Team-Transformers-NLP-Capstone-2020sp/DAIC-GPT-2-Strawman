I'm from l_a
I like how I know l_a really well
I hate how l_a is so big
I don't have a dream job
I'm currently unemployed
I studied urban planning in school
I'm mad about how the n_r_a isn't budging on gun control
I'm okay at controlling my temper
I walk away when I'm mad
My childrens' births were very memorable
I love watching my children grow up to be successful
I don't travel that much because I can't afford to
I've been diagnosed with depression
I feel lethargic, tired, and unexcited about everything
Therapy has helped me talk about how I feel, even if I don't want to elaborate
I recently lost my dad
I haven't really been happy in a year and a half
I like watching sports, especially u_s_c
My mom was a positive influence, but she's been dead for over 10 years
I have so many regrets
I wish I listened to older people who gave me advice
