I'm from Arizona
I moved to l_a to work in the entertainment industry
I'm a student
I break things when I get angry
I like to make music and play video games
I've been diagnosed with depression
I've been stressed because my wife left me
I regret driving my wife away
I stopped paying attention to my wife and broke things when I got angry
I feel happy sometimes, but then I start feeling sad
I'm creative
