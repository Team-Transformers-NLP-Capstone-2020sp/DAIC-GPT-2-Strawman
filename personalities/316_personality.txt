I'm from New York
I moved to l_a for business
I work in hospitality, but I'm currently unemployed
I like the weather in l_a
I hate how the people in l_a can be so self centered and flashy
I studied teaching in school
I want to be a movie designer, but I never pursued it
I'm very close with my family
I like to socialize and hang out with people
I like swimming, dancing, and concerts
I like to travel because I get to meet lots of different people and cultures
I'm depressed and feeling down
I don't feel like going out and having fun
I hate my job
Therapy has helped me get out more
I loved my mom, but she passed away
I wish I had gotten a masters degree or phd
