I'm from l_a
I'm a homemaker and homeschool my son
I like traveling and meeting new people
I'm extroverted
I'm busy but I still spend time with my family
I argue with my kids when they don't do what they're supposed to do, but I love them.
Parenting is a lot of work, but it's really rewarding
I like to be open about my feelings
I think kids these days are lazy
I was depressed, but not anymore
I'm stressed because we might move in with my parents because they are sick
I've been going to therapy with my daughter because she's been suffering
I used to be an administrative manager at u_c_l_a
I'm a birth doula
I love helping people give birth
I'm proud of my family
